# Assignment 1 ITP

## About Me

My name is Keetan Southwell, my student ID is 795652, my email address is keetan.southwell@gmail.com. I am a year 10 student and live on the North Shore of Sydney. I was born in Canada and moved to Sydney when I was 7. I have one Golden Retriever named Ryder.

### Interest in IT
My interest in IT started when I was very young. My dad was a software engineer for  a while before I was born and knowing this I have always taken an interest in IT. My interest in IT was mainly centred around animation and particularly computer graphics imaging because of my interest in movies from a young age. Mainly watching movies such as Star Wars caused this interest. When I became a little bit older I always had an obsession with finding out why things work the way they do. This lead on to my interest in computers, since they are such a large and integral part of our lives. From this, I became interested in the idea of information, software and technology electives at school and learning Java and C# through this subject has only sparked my interest more. So far I have completed the CPT 120 and CPT 121 courses at RMIT, so I have a medium experience in Java, as well as having completed the year 9 IST course and most of the year 10 course.

### Why I Chose RMIT
I have chosen to study at RMIT because it offered a wide range of IT courses available through Open Universities. The main reason was because of the options open through Open Uni, since I needed a convenient method that didn’t mean I needed to go to a venue to study my courses. RMIT was a stand-out option since it was a university that offered basic level courses, with no experience required for programming, which was originally why I chose it, then I progressed on to IT systems. I had RMIT recommended to me by a friend as well, who is currently taking this same course with me.

## My Ideal Job

[My ideal job](https://www.seek.com.au/job/39733656?searchrequesttoken=9f6a4ef6-eb8f-4918-9b2f-aa49fd6884c9&type=promoted) as a civil project manager.

### What is it?
The position is a management position, requiring an overseeing of all aspects of a construction site. Looking at contractors and their sub-groups, managing the planning and organisation of the site in question and questioning and dealing with architects and job site inspectors. This is appealing to me, not just because of the position, but also because of the steps needed to gain this experience to get into the position. The position requires years of experience in the engineering field, which is a decent job, but I also want to move up the ranks in a reputable company, and taking this job would allow me to do this. The idea of management is also appealing to me, because I enjoy being organised and scheduled in my life, and I think that proceeding in a management type position would help me to achieve this.

### Qualifications Needed or That Need to be Acquired
The qualifications I require for this position are: a university level of education in project management, more than 5 years of experience in the project management sector, have an Australian Institute of Project Management Certification, a General Construction Indication Card, a valid driver’s license, experience in contract management and the ability to write reports well and communicate with others.
Some of these I do have, which includes a driver’s license and what I feel to be good report writing skills and people skills.
To obtain the skills that I do not have for this position, I need to continue my studies at university to obtain a degree in management and work for smaller companies on smaller projects first so I have the required experience to do the job. To achieve my certification under AIPMI also need experience in the form of their point system. I will also need to apply for my GCIC through service NSW (because of the state I live in).
