# Assignment 1 ITP

## About Me

My name is Keetan Southwell, my student ID is 795652, my email address is keetan.southwell@gmail.com. I am a year 10 student and live on the North Shore of Sydney. I was born in Canada and moved to Sydney when I was 7. I have one Golden Retriever named Ryder.

### Interest in IT

My interest in IT started when I was very young. My dad was a software engineer for  a while before I was born and knowing this I have always taken an interest in IT. My interest in IT was mainly centred around animation and particularly computer graphics imaging because of my interest in movies from a young age. Mainly watching movies such as Star Wars caused this interest. When I became a little bit older I always had an obsession with finding out why things work the way they do. This lead on to my interest in computers, since they are such a large and integral part of our lives. From this, I became interested in the idea of information, software and technology electives at school and learning Java and C# through this subject has only sparked my interest more. So far I have completed the CPT 120 and CPT 121 courses at RMIT, so I have a medium experience in Java, as well as having completed the year 9 IST course and most of the year 10 course.

### Why I Chose RMIT

I have chosen to study at RMIT because it offered a wide range of IT courses available through Open Universities. The main reason was because of the options open through Open Uni, since I needed a convenient method that didn’t mean I needed to go to a venue to study my courses. RMIT was a stand-out option since it was a university that offered basic level courses, with no experience required for programming, which was originally why I chose it, then I progressed on to IT systems. I had RMIT recommended to me by a friend as well, who is currently taking this same course with me.

### What I Intend to Learn

During my studies at RMIT, I expect to learn about the application of IT systems in our everyday life. This includes simpler applications such as social media, to far more complex ones, such as the way IT systems impact on our daily life. I also expect to learn how to use GitHub in a proper manner and thus be introduced to a new way of editing a shared document online. Before this course, I thought that google drive would be the best way to share and edit the document from multiple locations, but I have realised that GitHub works just as well, and especially better if coding is involved. I also plan to learn more about university life and skills for time management, so when I eventually reach university, I am able to work around problems and manage my time better than I can now.

### Big 5 Personality Test
![Big 5 Test results](https://github.com/keetanSouthwell/ITP-Assignment-1/blob/master/Images/Big5.png)

### What do the Results Mean?
To me, these results mean that I generally have a personality that requires me to be very organised or in control of a situation. I am also easily distracted, thus I need to have a tactile form of learning so that I can work instead of fiddle or become distracted. I am more comfortable when not in a group, which conflicts with my ability to be in control. My results in the Myers-Briggs test show the same as my results in the other personality test, that I am highly introverted and not willing to interact with others as easily as I should be. The Myers-Briggs test also reveals that I value planning and care when completing tasks, which I do agree with, as I would classify myself as obsessive-compulsive.

### How is my Behaviour in a Team Influenced?
When I’m working in a team, my behaviour will be influenced in a contradicting way. This is because I have an introverted personality, but I also have a need to be in control. This means that while working with people I don’t know, I will have a need to convey my ideas, but will have no way to actually convey them because I am too introverted and I can’t do it efficiently or confidently. I should also consider that I become distracted easily, but am quick to get back to work. If I am not able to fidget or do something while I work, then I may not be able to concentrate on the work. Because of this, I should consider my likelihood of either become agitated or distracted in a group situation. I should strongly consider my ability to not see other people’s solutions as well, since I can get caught up in planning my own solution to a problem and then push this idea, instead of listening to other people’s solutions.

### How Should I Consider This Whne Building a Team?
When forming a team, I should probably make sure that they are a group of people that I would probably get along with better, as this means that I might be able to accept advice from these people, and share my ideas better, since I will be more comfortable. This means that I might need to be in a group of people who enjoy the same things, have a similar sense of humour, or people who are easier to talk to. I should also make sure that my teams views might somewhat align with mine, given that a conflict of interests is one of my biggest problems when working in teams because of my need to be in control. I might also want to consider the outlook of my team, whether it is positive, because as shown by the Big 5 test, I can be very negative, often pessimistic about the outlook of events such as approaching deadlines and the ability of the group to complete a task. I may also want a group that can frequently video call, since I am a visual learner and having something to look at while I do my work will help me to better understand from my group a reaction to an idea, or an emotion experienced, since I can see their facial expression.

## My Ideal Job

[My ideal job](https://www.seek.com.au/job/39733656?searchrequesttoken=9f6a4ef6-eb8f-4918-9b2f-aa49fd6884c9&type=promoted) as a civil infastructure project manager.

![Main Details](https://github.com/keetanSouthwell/ITP-Assignment-1/blob/master/IdealJob.png)

### What is it?
The position is a management position, requiring an overseeing of all aspects of a construction site. Looking at contractors and their sub-groups, managing the planning and organisation of the site in question and questioning and dealing with architects and job site inspectors. This is appealing to me, not just because of the position, but also because of the steps needed to gain this experience to get into the position. The position requires years of experience in the engineering field, which is a decent job, but I also want to move up the ranks in a reputable company, and taking this job would allow me to do this. The idea of management is also appealing to me, because I enjoy being organised and scheduled in my life, and I think that proceeding in a management type position would help me to achieve this.

### Qualifications Needed or That Need to be Acquired
The qualifications I require for this position are: a university level of education in project management, more than 5 years of experience in the project management sector, have an Australian Institute of Project Management Certification, a General Construction Indication Card, a valid driver’s license, experience in contract management and the ability to write reports well and communicate with others.
Some of these I do have, which includes a driver’s license and what I feel to be good report writing skills and people skills.
To obtain the skills that I do not have for this position, I need to continue my studies at university to obtain a degree in management and work for smaller companies on smaller projects first so I have the required experience to do the job. To achieve my certification under AIPMI also need experience in the form of their point system. I will also need to apply for my GCIC through service NSW (because of the state I live in).

## Project Idea
### Overview

The project to be designed is a 3D modelled physics engine with real world physics in it where it comes preloaded with certain materials that you can insert and test in a 3D space. Essentially the program will act similarly to Sketchup or other 3D modelling software, except it can take into account real-world physics at work, such as wind and aerodynamics, building load, stress and strain on materials and the weight and structural integrity of different, pre-generated materials, ranging from all different types of concrete, to cables and steel beams. The program will mainly be used as an assistant to engineers so they can see in real time roughly what happens to their proposed ideas is they were to be constructed in the real world.

### Motivation

Residents of Sydney’s Opal Tower were evacuated when the building began cracking on December 24th 2018. Following this cladding fires swept up the Neo200 building in Melbourne in February of 2019 and Mascot Towers in Sydney were closed due to cracking in June of the same year. This shows that there has been a major crisis in the structural design of buildings in recent years and a program that modelled scenarios that these buildings may undergo. The scenario generator would have the building be tested before it went up over time and thus eliminate all of these possible areas of failure.

### Description

The program would first have to model the most common building materials for houses, skyscrapers and bridges. These would be as follows: reinforced concrete, steel in  variety of options such as struts or beams and cladding in the form of glass, steel, aluminium, granite, marble or limestone. Each of these materials, among the many others that would be used to make up the interior, including drywall could be rendered in the program. The program would allow you to construct the building in a similar way to how Sketchup would construct a model or building. It would have all of the same tools, such as drawing tools, push and pull tools, measuring tools etc, except the paint tool would allow the user to instead of just colour a surface with the desired texture, to alter the physical properties of the structure.  The ground could also be changed in the simulation to different materials such as slate, sandstone, disrupted sand, or bedrock. It would also have an option for the ground to be a solid block for testing purposes without the ground. The simulation could model the weather in the simulation as well, even being able to model extreme weather such as hurricanes and flooding. This would help determine the aerodynamics of the building. Temperature would also be a used in the building, to determine if scenarios such as frost heaving or heatwaves would affect the structural integrity of the building. The program would have a run button inserted into it, where when pressed, would apply the physics generator to the simulation. The simulation, when the physics were applied, would make it so all surfaces would fall as they would towards the ground in a real world scenario. When weather is factored in, the ground and building interacts with the weather as it would in a normal scenario. For example, this can include the weather being rainy, thus, the slate in the ground would turn to clay. From this, the foundation would need to be more stable to compensate for this difference in the ground. The simulation would also test to see, at the same time as the ground difference, if the building would be affected by any wind in the area at the time. All of the factors working at the same time would determine if the building, with its given materials, would undergo any failures such as cracks, damage, or loose pieces. This would all happen in real time as well. As the simulation progressed, the user could adjust the speed, to see if the building would hold itself over a number of years under pre-programmed circumstances. All of this would help to determine the long term circumstances that the building underwent. 

### Tools and Technologies

The first step would be the software required to run the program. It would mainly be based off of the Sketchup operating system, but additional features would be added. This would be the physics engine, which can be modelled in certain programs that have already been created, such as Unity, which has its own physics engine, and most importantly to create this project would be the information of the materials that would be needed. These would all need to be tested and then entered. This includes weight, density, mass, aerodynamic profiles, tensile and shear strength, limits of stress and strain and ways to anchor it to a surface. All of these need to be tested and loaded into the simulation, and a graph of the materials as they increased in size would need to be formed so that the simulation could speculate what would happen if the objects that were tested were of different dimensions than the ones that the simulation was modelled off. The simulation would also require an absurdly powerful computer system to run it, because of the all of the complex mathematics and animations that would be happening all at once.

### Skills Required

To find the software that would be necessary wouldn’t be too hard since it already exists in a variety of programs. The only difference would be to apply all of the code from separate programs into one large program. The modelling of the physics in all different scenarios would be the difficult part and may not be feasible because there are so many options and so many different materials that need to be modelled in the real world. It could be done, but it require a very large amount of manpower to do because each material would have to be coded. The hardware would also have to be acquired and put together. This would likely be a very powerful computer system.

### Outcome

The outcome of the project should be a large decrease in building failures because of the physics engine of the system. This would solve the original problem of there being too many building failures in cities. The program would also be a great way to teach engineering students about building technique without wasting materials or time on physically building structures. In the real world, there is no room for testing and experimentation, but this program would allow for this. There may be new developments because of it, as new building materials were tested by different users of the program.
